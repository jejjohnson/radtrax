# Code review

Read "Reuse before you write", "The contracts" and "What enforces them" in
[`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md); for every function, class or module the
diff adds, search [`docs/api/capabilities.md`](../../../docs/api/capabilities.md)
for an existing equivalent; then apply [`CODE_REVIEW.md`](../../../CODE_REVIEW.md)
and report in its format.

The full procedure, with the reuse and correctness checklists, is the
`mypackage-review` recipe in
[`.claude/skills/mypackage-review/SKILL.md`](../../../.claude/skills/mypackage-review/SKILL.md)
and the two reviewers in [`.claude/agents/`](../../../.claude/agents/).

name: add-guide-page
description: Add or update a prose page in the MyST half of the docs — a guide page under docs/guide (or a top-level page under docs/) in MyST Markdown with directives, xref links to the API by top-level name, a toc entry in docs/myst.yml, a unique basename, a link back from the API page, and the assembled docs build. Use when asked to write or fix a guide, tutorial text, explanation or any non-notebook prose page.

# Add or update a guide page

Read "Documentation" in `AGENTS.md` first; `docs/README.md` explains the
two-tool build.

## 1. Where it goes

- A guide to one part of the package: `docs/guide/<topic>.md`, listed under
  `Guide` in the `toc` of `docs/myst.yml`.
- A project-level page (contributing, changelog, agents): `docs/<name>.md`,
  in the matching toc section.
- An executable walkthrough is a notebook instead (`add-notebook`); an API
  page under `docs/api/` is MkDocs, not MyST (`add-function`).
- The basename must be unique across `docs/`, `docs/guide/` and
  `docs/notebooks/`: the page is served at `/<basename>/` (`_` → `-`), and
  frontmatter `slug:` is ignored.

## 2. Write it in MyST

- Directives, not MkDocs-Material syntax: `:::{note}`, `:::{tip}`,
  `:::{dropdown} Title`, `::::{tab-set}` / `:::{tab-item}`, `::::{grid}` /
  `:::{grid-item-card}` (see `docs/index.md` and `docs/guide/*.md`).
- Maths with `$…$` and `$$…$$`.
- Link the API with the `xref:` protocol and the **top-level** name:
  ``[`summarize`](xref:api#mypackage.summarize)``. Links to other prose pages
  are relative paths to their source files (`[CLI](guide/cli.md)`).
- Code blocks are illustrative (nothing executes them): run every snippet
  yourself and paste real output.

## 3. Wire it in

- The `toc` entry in `docs/myst.yml`.
- If an API page covers the same module, link the guide from it the way
  `docs/api/stats.md` does (`[statistics guide](../../statistics/)` — the
  flat URL, relative to `/reference/<page>/`).

## 4. Verify

`make docs` builds both halves, assembles them and fails on any broken
internal link, including links between the halves; `make docs-check`
validates both halves without rendering the theme. Both need the mystmd CLI
(`npm install -g mystmd`; if the theme download is blocked, see
`docs/README.md`).
